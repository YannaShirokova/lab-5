For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!

## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

### Tips 

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.


## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| label: read-in-data

library(tidyverse)

# If purrr is not detected, install the package
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")

```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on January 15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the person responsible for the murder?!

**Follow the evidence to the person responsible for the murder, building a report as you go.**
Hint: Make sure you check for interviews with any suspects!

```{r}
#| label: inspecting-crime-scene-report

# Look at first clues
# Murder
# Jan 15, 2018
# SQL city
crime_scene_report |>
  filter(city == "SQL City", 
         type == "murder", 
         date == "20180115") |>
  select(description)

```
### Looking at Witnesses
```{r}
#| label: looking-at-witnesses

# Lets find witnesses and look at their interviews
# Clues:
# The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr"
# The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave"

person |>
  filter(
    (address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr" & 
     address_number == max(address_number)) | 
    (str_detect(name, "Annabel") &
    address_street_name == "Franklin Ave")) |>
  left_join(interview, by = c("id" = "person_id")) |>
  select(transcript)

```
### Finding the Murderer based on Interviews
```{r}
#| label: finding-the-murderer

# Lets see what we can find from the interviews

# Clues: 
# The membership number on the bag started with "48Z"
# I was working out last week on January the 9th
membership_ids <- get_fit_now_check_in |>
  filter(str_detect(membership_id, "^48Z"),
         check_in_date == "20180109") |>
  select(membership_id)

# Clue: The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W"
driver_ids <- drivers_license |>
  filter(gender == "male", 
         str_detect(plate_number, "H42W")) |>
  select(id)

# Find the person id from driver_ids (above)
person_ids <- driver_ids |>
  inner_join(person, by = c("id" = "license_id")) |>
  select(id = id.y)

# Join on the person id from person_ids (above)
# Join on the membership_ids (above)
# Clue: Only gold members have those bags. 
get_fit_now_member |>
  inner_join(person_ids, by = c("person_id" = "id")) |>
  inner_join(membership_ids, by = c("id" = "membership_id")) |>
  filter(membership_status == "gold")

```

## And the final suspect is... 

*Put the name of the person responsible for the murder here:*

Jeremy Bowers!
